## Now lets break it down:
```py
import sys

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print('Invalid args')
        return None
    password = sys.argv[1]
    builder = 0
    '''
    This is a for loop.
    If the password is hello, then c would first be assigned the character h.
    Then when the loop repeats, c would now be e.
    Then l and so forth.
    c is just a variable created and used, it can be anything you want it be.
    for a in password:
    for alphabet in password: 
    '''
    for c in password:
        # Again, they are adding the ordinal value of each character to builder
        builder += ord(c)
    
    # In this block of code they are performing Bitwise operations. 
    # NOTE: You don't need to understand this entirely, but I will explain it anyway.
    
    # LEft Shift: The left operands value is moved left by the number of bits specified by the right operand.
    builder = builder << 2
    # Ones Complement : It is unary and has the effect of 'flipping' bits.
    builder = ~builder
    # XOR : It copies the bit if it is set in one operand but not both.
    builder = builder ^ 12648430
    builder = ~builder
    
    if builder == 12645638 and ord(password[0]) == 78 and len(password) == 11:
        print('correct')
    else:
        print('incorrect')


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Now lets create a program that does the reverse and will spit out the password
```py
# Copy the value of builder, after the bitwise operations.
builder = 12645638

# Reverse it
builder = ~builder
builder = builder ^ 12648430
builder = ~builder
builder = builder >> 2

print('The beginning ordinal value of builder was: ', builder)

# We know that the first character has an ordinal value of 78 and the total length is 11 characters.
print('First character is: ', chr(78))
builder -= 78
print('Builder is now at the value of: ', builder)

# We have 10 characters left, 620 divided by 10 is a flat, 62. Hmm.
print('The character value of 62, is: ', chr(62))
# Looks like we have a password :D
# N followed by 10 '>'. Lets try it out, but when you do, put the password in double quotes, "".

```
