## The original program is as follows:
```py
#!/usr/bin/python

import sys

def main():
  if len(sys.argv) != 2:
    print("Invalid args")
    return
  password = sys.argv[1]
  builder = 0
  for c in password:
    builder += ord(c) 

  if builder == 1000 and len(password) == 10 and ord(password[1]) == 83:
    print("correct")
  else:
    print("incorrect")

if __name__ == "__main__":
  main()
```

### Lets break down the program first:
```py
#NOTE: # tells python this is a comment, while ''' or """ is what's called a block comment (multi-line comment)

# The shebang to let the system know the interpreters location to run the program.
#!/usr/bin/python

# import is used when you want to use certain functions from another module (file), which in this case
# Is the sys (system) module.
import sys

# def is used when you want to define (create) a function
def main():
  '''
  sys.argv 'the list of command line arguments passed to a script': ex. python script.py item1 item2 
  in this example, sys.argv[1] is item1 because indexing (the [1]) starts at 0. 
  So the system argument 0 would be the script name, and so forth.
  This checks if there are 2 arguments passed to the progr
  m, if not, then print Invalid args.
  '''
  if len(sys.argv) != 2:  
    print("Invalid args")
    return
  # The argument you pass (after the script name) will be used assigned to the variable password
  password = sys.argv[1]
  # A variable called builder is assigned the value of 0
  builder = 0
  # for loop steps through each character of the string (assigned to password)
  for c in password: 
    '''
    the ord returns the value of a character. 
    Ex: "a" and "b" as ord('a') == 97 and ord('b') == 98
        open a terminal, type python, type ord('a') then press enter.
    To do the reverse of the ord do chr(number) which converts a unicode value back to a character
    So this is shorthand for builder = builder + ord(c)
    It's adding the ord(c) to the previous value of builder.
    '''
    builder += ord(c) 
  '''
  Now here we see a long if statement, lets break it down.                      
  if builder is eqaul to 1000 and the length of the password is 10 characters 
  and the ordinal value of the second letter is 83, print correct.
  else print incorrect.
  '''
  if builder == 1000 and len(password) == 10 and ord(password[1]) == 83:
    print("correct")
  else:
    print("incorrect")

# linking scripts together. If a script runs directly then __name__ is equal to __main__ 
# but if you import it, it will not. 
if __name__ == "__main__": 
  main()
```

### Now we can proceed and create a script that will try and provide a correct password.
```py
# So we know that the password is 10 characters long and has an ordinal value of 1000.
# lets assign the variable builder a value of 1000, and essentially do the reverse.
builder = 1000

# We know that the second letter must have an ordinal value of 83, well what is that value?
print("The second character with an ordinal value of 83 is: ", chr(83))

# Now that's one character down. (Using shorthand here)
builder -= 83

'''
So we have 9 characters left, you would think lets divide builder by 9, get the ordinal of that value and 
we repeat that character 9 times. Wrong. But on the right track.
builder / 9 == 101.88.. -- so 101. The chr of 101 is 'e'. 
If we do 101 * 9 + 83 that leaves us with an ordinal value of 992. Not 1000.
What if we do 101 * 8 + 83 ? We get 891. What's 1000-891 -> 109. chr(109) is m. Looks like we got a password! :D
'''

# Note: In python 3, it'll automatically result in a float (decimal) so we must make it an int (integer).
print('builder / 9 as an integer is: ', int(builder / 9))
print("Char of 101 is: ", chr(101))
print('101 * 8 is: ', 101 * 8)
print('1000 - 891 is: ', 1000-891)
print('Our last char needed is: ', chr(1000-891))

# So from here you can guess that any combination of 8 e's, 1 m, and the second character being an S will work.
# So mSeeeeeeee or eSmeeeeeee and so on will work. 
```

### But how do we test some code in python or run the program(s) and then test our password?
```sh
# Open a terminal and type 
python
# Now we can interact with the python interpreter. Which allows you to run python code, so for example:
ord('a')
# And it'll show the result.
# But what if we want to run a program?
# First exit the python interpreter (or open a new terminal/tab.), type: (or press ctrl+z)
exit()

# Move to the directory containing the program(s), then type:
python program-name.py 
# If you want to run the program and test your password, type:
python program-name.py password123

```
