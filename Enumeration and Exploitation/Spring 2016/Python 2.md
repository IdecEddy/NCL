# The given file is a python program. However, it is compiled (.pyc) so we must first decompile it.

```sh

# Open a terminal and run the following commands to get the tool to decompile it:
apt-get install git
# NOTE: You need pip however, pip is already installed if you are using Python 2.79 and greater. 
# To check python version run:
python -V

git clone https://github.com/rocky/python-uncompyle6.git
cd python-uncompyle6

# NOTE: you will need root permissions for the the following commmands.
pip install -e .
pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
python setup.py install

# Now lets decompile the program:
cd /path/to/file/
uncompyle6 python-program-name.pyc > decompiled.py
```

## We now have the following decompiled code:

```py
# NOTE: What I have cut out, is not necessary, so remove it. It's leftover from the uncompyle6 program.

## Lets break it down.

# NOTE: What should be understood is not explained/commented.
import sys

def main():
    if len(sys.argv) != 2:
        print 'Invalid args'
        return
    password = sys.argv[1]

    if len(password) != len(vals):

    # This is a while loop, so while the counter variable value is less then the length of the password, do this.

        # x gets assigned the ordinal value of password[0] - the first character, + 7.
        x = ord(password[counter]) + 7

            return

        counter += 1
    # Everything passed, so print correct.
    print 'correct'


if __name__ == '__main__':
    main()
```

## Lets create the program to spit out the password
```py

# We need the list that they  so lets copy it over
vals = list('tfzbwlyzljylawhzzdvyk')

# We need a blank list so that our password will be assigned to it.
password = []

# Now we replicate the while loop and just reverse the process:
counter = 0
while counter < len(vals):
  x = ord(vals[counter]) - 7
  if x < ord('a'):
    x += 26
  # Append the valid password to the list
  password.append(chr(x))
  counter += 1

print(password)
```
